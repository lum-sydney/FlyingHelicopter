# FlyingHelicopter
 *Hi, thank you for looking and trying my Java program! :D
 
 * I wanted to make an animated ASCII flying helicopter that is 10 lines tall, 23 characters wide, that consists of two frames.
 * ASCII(American Standard Code of Information Interchange)- a way to display images using the usable 95/128 characters on the keyboard
